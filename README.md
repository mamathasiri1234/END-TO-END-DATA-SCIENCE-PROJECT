DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK 3: This project involves a mixture of data science (ML model), software development (Flask/FastAPI API), and deployment. You can build upon this by adding additional features, such as advanced code analysis, more user inputs, or real-time code evaluation.
Goal: Develop a system that classifies whether a code submission is correct or incorrect (based on success or failure in solving the problem).

Example Use Case: A coding competition platform that automatically grades submissions.



2. Data Collection:

Collect data related to user submissions, such as:

Code snippets (e.g., raw code or abstract representations).

Metadata about the submission (e.g., time taken, user history, submission size).

Problem characteristics (e.g., problem complexity, type).
